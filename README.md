<p align="center">
  Game project for the Global Game Jam 2026.
  <br><br>

  <br><br>
  This years Global Game Jam has the main theme "masks". In this game the player can put on different masks to change the season of the level. Changing the seasons provides the player different ways to interact with the world around, e.g. gliding in windy autumns or walking on ice instead of swimming.
